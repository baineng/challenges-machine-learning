* Challenges Machine Learning
** Objective?

This project is mainly using for personal study. But still hope it can help others who are also interesting in ML.

** How this project composed?

It's composed by different categories, Each category will talk about a kind of Machine Learning scenarios, algorithms, models, or even libraries.

And most of them will be discribed by a ipython notebook with runnable code.

* Catalog
*** 1. Libraries
**** 1.1 Numpy
#+BEGIN_SRC php
<?php
echo 'abc';
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: abc

**** 1.2 Panda
**** 1.3 Matplotlib
**** 1.4 ...
*** 2. Regression
**** 2.1 SImple Linear Regression
**** 2.2 Multiple Linear Regression
**** 2.3 Logistic Regression
*** 4. ...

* Motivation

This project is inspired by [[https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code][100-Days-Of-ML-Code]] and [[https://github.com/dennyzhang/challenges-kubernetes][challenges-kubernetes]]

Mainly for self study, I will be so glad if it helped others as well.
