#+TITLE Challenges Machine Learning

* Introduction

** Object?
This project is mainly using for personal study. But still hope it can help others who are also interesting in ML.
** How this project composed?
It's composed by different sections, Each section will talk about a kind of Machine Learning scenarios, or algorithms, models, or even libraries.
And most of them will be discribed by a ipython notebook with runnable code.

* Catalog
** 1. Libraries
*** 1.1 Numpy
*** 1.2 Panda
*** 1.3 Matplotlib
*** 1.4 ...
** 2. Linear Regression
*** 2.1 SImple Linear Regression
*** 2.2 Multiple Linear Regression
** 3. Logistic Regression
** 4. ...

* Motivation
This project is inspired by [[https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code][100-Days-Of-ML-Code]] and [[https://github.com/dennyzhang/challenges-kubernetes][challenges-kubernetes]], And manly using for self study.
I will try to cover more details compare to 100-Days-Of-ML-Code.
